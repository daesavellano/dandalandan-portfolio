## Outline

### Filipinos bring Christmas everywhere—but back home, storms keep many from celebrating at all.

Filipinos are known for bringing Christmas wherever we go, typically starting as soon as September 1st. Whether in large, well-established communities (like those in California, Hawaii, Nevada, and New York) or in smaller diasporic pockets (like the Filipino American Association of Pittsburgh or FAAP), Filipinos recreate the warmth and traditions we grew up with: parols, noche buena, caroling, Simbang Gabi, and the Filipino spirit of holiday generosity.

But while Filipino Americans celebrate, many families in the Philippines experience Christmas very differently. Typhoons have become more frequent and more intense, and a lot of them hit during the holiday season. **These storms don’t just damage houses—they interrupt the joy of Christmas.** For some families, it means canceled gatherings, unsafe homes, a lack of electricity, or not being able to celebrate at all.

This project aims to use data on typhoon frequency and regional impact to tell that story. The goal isn’t just to show that storms happen (most people already know that), but to help viewers understand what these disasters mean for families during a time that’s supposed to be merry. **I hope the project encourages empathy and action from Filipino Americans and allies**, especially those who already care about the Philippines but might not know how to give help.

This idea also came from conversations with leaders from FAAP, who said they often **struggle to advocate for storm-related relief when talking to local organizations** in Pittsburgh, especially when headlines across the world come and go so often. I wanted to create something that helps make that case clearer through data and storytelling.

### Reader’s Perspective

- As a reader, I want to understand how typhoons affect families in the Philippines—especially during the Christmas season—so I can better appreciate the scale of the problem and make informed, meaningful decisions about how to support storm-impacted communities.
- Target readers include Overseas Filipino Workers, Filipino-Americans, allies, and community members.

**Call to Action**
1. **Support** verified, community-led Philippine disaster relief efforts this Christmas—whether through donations, local Filipino organizations, or awareness-building—so families affected by storms can reclaim the warmth and joy of the holiday season.
2. **Start** your own efforts with a local organization.

## Initial sketches

Sketches were made to see how each page would look like using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAG5CuAUwrA/apSaE_QUrxyX1CVYnXvmLA/edit?utm_content=DAG5CuAUwrA&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton), along with draft visualizations based on available data. Data will need to be studied further to better understand how to visualize information and communicate the story.

## Data Sources
The project aims to use datasets covering typhoons, regional human impact measures, migration demographics, and remittance flows. The typhoon datasets establish the intensity and distribution of storms across the Philippines from 2014–2024. The impact data provides regional-level damage for only a few typhoons per year. Furthermore, it requires cleaning due to the inclusion of total statistics and regional statistics in addition to provincial statistics.

To connect climate events to diasporic patterns, the project will also draw on demographic data from the Pew Research Center describing U.S.-based Filipino populations from 2000–2023, along with remittance data from the World Bank Group that documents decades of financial flows sent home. Together, these datasets can help situate typhoons within a broader socioeconomic and geographic context, illustrating how extreme weather intersects with migration, remittances, and community vulnerability.

I have not played with data extensively yet, so it will be exciting to see what type of information I might be able to find. All datasets are accessible to CMU-affiliated accounts on [Box](https://cmu.app.box.com/folder/351579774913?s=t8ojb3kr6i4lgyo87j457zqfy46ys656).

In addition to these data sources, I also aim to read up on a number of newspaper articles from American and Philippine sources, as they might be helpful for framing the story.

## Method and medium

The final visualizations will be developed in **Tableau**, with minor data cleaning and preprocessing done using Excel or Python. The story will be displayed using **Shorthand** and also featured on my personal portfolio. The goal of the project is for users to be able to gather most of the information they need on the topic to be inspired to take action, perform additional research, and spread the word to others. If time permits, I would also like to tackle the fundraising planning aspect of the project. However, that is not a priority since it is outside the scope of the class.
