# The Final Data Story

<a href="https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/silent-night-stormy-plight-the-typhoons-that-stole-filipino-christmas/index.html" style="background-color: #D8BFE3; color: #121729; padding: 12px 20px; display: inline-block; border-radius: 14px;"><b>Silent Night, Stormy Plight</b> (Final Version)</a>

## Changes Since Part II

For the final version, I focused on improving the emotional storytelling by providing critical context to help ground the narrative in both geography and economic reality.

1. **Adding Context for Geography and Vulnerability**: A key insight from Part II feedback was that audiences unfamiliar with the Philippines didn't fully grasp the "why." I added a section explaining the country's archipelagic nature and its location in the Pacific Typhoon Belt to show why it is so prone to storms. This may still be improved, given that I won't always be there to explain it, but for now it will do. I also detailed how many communities are dependent on agriculture and fisheries. This context highlights that a typhoon isn't just an immediate safety hazard or the loss of electricity, it represents income lost, schools destroyed, and food security threatened. This helps the audience understand that this is a systemic issue.

2. **Expanding Quantitative Measures**: To complement the narrative, I wanted to show the scale of the geographic impact. I added more robust quantitative measures visualized through an interactive map. This allows users to toggle between metrics such as agricultural economic loss, infrastructural damage, and lives impacted. My goal was to demonstrate that the devastation extends far beyond the immediate storm, causing long-term economic setbacks.

3. **Connecting Dollars to Pesos**: I realized my original "Call to Action" was a long list that felt abstract. Users in the U.S. might not understand how far their dollar goes in the Philippines, especially given inflation and currency conversion rates. To make this concrete, I created a hand-drawn image comparing a standard U.S. coffee shop order to a Christmas Eve feast (Noche Buena) for a family of four in the Philippines. This visualization transformed a donation into a more tangible breakfast/dinner comparison, making the impact of giving feel immediate and personal.

# Presentation Mode

I greatly shortened the content for the live presentation version of the story. Knowing that my one-minute presentation was for a general audience (many with zero knowledge on Filipinos), I focused primarily on creating an immediate emotional connection through photography and videography rather than text density.

I specifically cut out many of the introductory text sections. However, I kept the visual contrast technique: zooming out from the nativity scene (setting the festive focus) and then zooming in while walking through the rubble post-typhoon (revealing the reality). I received a lot of positive feedback on that specific visual sequence during the feedback session, and the lineup of videos did the heavy lifting, allowing me to keep the text minimal and impactful.

# The audience

From the ideation phase, I knew exactly who my target audience was: **the Filipino diaspora**. More specifically, I wanted to reach out to Filipinos and Filipino-Americans in the United States, as well as their allies. I consider these populations to be people who are culturally connected to the Philippines but geographically removed from the immediate physical impact of the storms.

This audience was identified during my first unofficial interview with Filipino Americans in the U.S. and refined through many informal conversations with Filipino high school friends who studied abroad. Furthermore, during this process, I became much more involved with the Filipino community in Pittsburgh, which helped me tailor the narrative to resonate with our shared cultural nostalgia for Christmas.

# Final design decisions and story snippets

For the final design, I used a Christmas-adjacent color palette with dark teals and reds. This helped keep the presentation visually cohesive without being garish or overly commercial. I especially thought that a bright, cheery red would have felt disrespectful given the topic of disaster. This allowed me to visually signal the holiday season while maintaining the seriousness required. I also used brighter colors for happier imagery and darker colors for more solemn themes (ex. quotes).

I attached screenshots for a number of pages in my final project to help show my design decisions.
