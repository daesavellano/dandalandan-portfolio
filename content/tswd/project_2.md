# Storyboarding and Prototyping

## Canva Wireframe and Shorthand Prototype

In Part 1, I developed a wireframe using Canva. This became the basis for Part 2, but with adjustments based on the information I retrieved from the data files and the availability of copyright-free images and videos.

<a href="../project_1" style="background-color: #fff; color: #121729; padding: 12px 20px; display: inline-block; border-radius: 14px;"><b>Original Storyboard</b> (Project Phase 1)</a>

For Part 2, I moved directly into a high-fidelity mockup/prototype using Shorthand to better visualize the scrolling transitions and stollytelling elements of the narrative. The story follows a specific arc designed to take the reader from nostalgia to reality to action.

<a href="https://preview.shorthand.com/i8oKZWB4eekrjxKr" style="background-color: #D8BFE3; color: #121729; padding: 12px 20px; display: inline-block; border-radius: 14px;"><b>Draft Shorthand Story</b> (Project Phase 2)</a>

## The Story Arc

1. **The Hook** (A Long Christmas): The story opens with Black & White imagery of Christmas, transitioning into color to represent the joy and light of the season. For non-Filipino (and Filipino) readers, emphasis was put on the Ber months.

2. **The Conflict** (The Uninvited Guest):

    - Here, I transition from a *"Christmas is an amazing season"* to a *"...but not for everyone"* angle
    - Visualizations in this phase include photos after a storm, directly addressing comments in an in-class critique of my wireframe ("no shelter, no electricity, no Christmas").
    - I also included a quote that I found to be particularly striking: *"We always celebrated Christmas, but for now, it’s too hard."*

3. **The Human Cost** (A Dark Christmas):
    There are also visualizations and callout statistics regarding the human cost of typhoons, and specifically Christmas typhoons.
    - It starts with general statistics (i.e., #1 rank on World Risk Index, increasing frequency of storms, and the seasonal overlap of typhoons and the months leading to December)
    - There are general statistics on Pilippine internally displaced persons due to disasters, along with cost-breakdowns of wellbeing losses and asset losses
    - It is followed by stacked bar charts that highlight specific typhoons (Ruby, Nona, Tisoy, Ursula) that made landfall close to December 25. The charts visualize *"People Affected"* (millions) and *"Damaged Houses"*(hundreds of thousands).

4. **The Call to Action** (A Giving Christmas): In this section, I talk about how distance doesn't mean disconnection.
    - I use traditional Filipino context like *"bayanihan"*, along with matching photos.
    - I outline specific steps that can be done from the U.S., such as (donating, monitoring the PH government, organizing local initiatives, and sharing the story).
    - I emphasize the USD/PHP exchange rate, comparing a Philippine feast to an American cup of coffee.

# User research 

## Target audience

My primary audience includes the Filipino diaspora (specifically Filipino-Americans) and allies who are culturally connected to the Philippines but geographically removed from the immediate impact of storms.

To find representative individuals, I reached out to the following:

| Interviewee | Description | Goal |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| **Community Members** | One adult officer and youth member from a Filipino-American organization, to see if the story aligns with their advocacy needs. | Test if the story content and call to action align with their advocacy and fundraising messaging. |
| **U.S.-born Filipinos** | A Filipino-American student who grew up in the U.S. celebrates Filipino-Chinese Christmas Eve, and "relies on news to understand conditions back home." | Test if the cultural terminology (e.g., Simbang Gabi) is accessible and if the data is necessary for an already-aware group. |
| **Immigrant Filipinos (Youth)** | A Filipino-American student who moved to the U.S. at a young age (middle school), celebrates Filipino Christmas Eve, and is "not too aware of what is going on at home beyond generic information." | Test for emotional resonance and memory recall. Does the nostalgia hook connect effectively for someone with faint memories? |
| **Immigrant Filipinos (Older Generation)** | A Filipino-American who moved to the U.S. during their college years, celebrates American Christmas Eve, and is "not too aware of what is going on at home beyond from Facebook headlines." | Test for emotional resonance and memory recall. Does the nostalgia hook connect effectively for someone with faint memories? |
| **Non-Filipino-American** | Non-Filipino friends, with varying involvement with Filipinos | Test for clarity and universal appeal. Does the non-Filipino reader find the narrative compelling and the cultural context easy to grasp? |

I also conducted interviews for my Part 1 wireframe, with results found below. Furthermore, in-class interviews will be done again (prior to changes from target audience interviews) to see if there is an improvement in how it is received.

## Interview script

User research centers on assessing the prototype's effectiveness across three dimensions:
1. **Emotional Resonance**: Does the arc from nostalgia to action work?
2. **Data Clarity**: Are the graphs and statistics overwhelming or helpful?
3. **Cultural Context Accessibility**: Do non-Filipino and/or U.S.-born readers understand key terms and the significance of Christmas typhoons?

Below is a list of questions I am interested in asking. Some questions may only apply for certain demographics.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|To determine baseline associations for Christmas|*[Before showing prototype]* When you think of Christmas, what images come to mind? Are you aware of the weather patterns during that time?|
|To check emotional impact|How did the use of imagery impact your experience with the website? *(Potential Follow-up: How did the transition from the 'Christmas' images to the 'Storm' images make you feel?)*|
|To evaluate cultural context|For the terms 'Noche Buena' or 'Bayanihan', did you feel you needed more explanation to understand the significance?|
|To assess use of data|What did you feel about the use of graphs and statistics? *(Potential Follow-up: Were they overwhelming? Helpful? Necessary?)*|
|To assess data labeling clarity|Were there any unclear terms to you? *(Potential follow-up: Some examples are terms like "people affected," "people displaced," "damaged houses," and "wellbeing vs asset losses")*|
|To assess quote resonance|Do you feel like you know how to help? Or know where to look to find ways to help?|
|To assess call to action|After reading the end of the story, do you feel like you know how to help?|
|To see if the coffee comparison landed well|Is the connection between 'coffee money' and 'exchange rate' motivating? *(Potential Follow-up: Does it motivate you to donate, or does it feel like marketing?)*|
|To see sharability|Would you feel comfortable sharing this link with your own family/network?|

## Interview findings

### Phase 1 Critique and Changes Made

#### Group Interview

| Detail | Description |
|------|------------------|
|**Participants**|Three graduate students from non-Filipino/American backgrounds: (1) MS Information Systems Management (2nd Year), (1) MS Public Policy and Management - Flagship (2nd Year), and (1) MS Public Policy and Management - Data Analytics (1st Year).|
|**Methodology**|Due to time constraints, this was a short, unstructured walk-through of the wireframe, not a formal user-testing session. Feedback was qualitative and primarily driven by one participant.|
|**Limitation**|The session did not simulate a true user experience, and the dominance of one participant's perspective (MSPPM - Flagship) made comprehensive questioning difficult.|

#### Key Findings

| Category | Finding | Actionable Takeaway for Part 2 |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| **Narrative Hook & Title** | Interviewee 2 suggested linking the title to a common Christmas theme (ex. *"It's the most wonderful time of the year, except here"*). Participants agreed and felt this would have more emotional resonance. | I adjusted the title and narrative opening to immediately have the Christmas themes. I also moved the "About the Project" section to the bottom of the Shorthand story since it was not serving the narrative. |
| **Data Integration & Relevance** | Interviewee 2 specifically requested data on the frequency of typhoons and their relevance to Christmas. The other participants initially missed or did not understand the relevance of Christmas to the typhoon data in the wireframe. | I ensured that the data visualizations for specific Christmas-adjacent typhoons were front-and-center and clearly labeled to drive home the narrative's central statistics. |
| **Data Volume vs. Imagery** | There were mixed perspectives on data volume. Interviewee 2 suggested including statistics on "No electricity. No gatherings. No stable income" (related to well-being loss), but another interviewee cautioned against making the piece too data-heavy. Overall, photos were preferred over numerous graphs. | I decided to have all the data-heavy pages in one area. I will add more information on human impact in numbers, but prioritize storytelling with photography/videography. Data will be used to validate the narrative, but not overpower it. |

### Phase 2 Critique

<!-- In-class Critique

| Questions to Ask | Interviewee 1 | Interviewee 2 |
|------|------------------|------------------|
|*[Before showing prototype]* When you think of Christmas, what images come to mind?|
|How did the use of imagery impact your experience with the website?|
|Were there any unclear terms to you? *(Potential follow-up: Some examples are terms like "people affected," "people displaced," "damaged houses," and "wellbeing vs asset losses")*|
|*(Potential follow-up for earlier question)* For the terms 'Noche Buena' or 'Bayanihan', did you feel you needed more explanation to understand the significance?|
|What did you feel about the use of graphs and statistics? *(Potential Follow-up: Were they overwhelming? Helpful? Necessary?)*|
Do you remember the selected quotes? What were your thoughts on them?|
|Do you feel like you know how to help? Or know where to look to find ways to help?|
|Is the connection between 'coffee money' and 'exchange rate' motivating? *(Potential Follow-up: Does it motivate you to donate, or does it feel like marketing?)*|
|Would you feel comfortable sharing this link with your own family/network?| -->

As a disclaimer, some of the information below has been translated, especially when talking to Filipino community members. Each interview was conducted separately, with the exception of the two community members interviewed side-by-side. Each interview took approximately 20-40 minutes, depending on how much information was shared. I also had off-the-record conversations with the interviewees and with other Filipinos I knew who moved to the U.S. or who were born in the U.S.

| Questions to Ask | **Adult Officer (Community Member)** | **Youth Member (Community Member)** | **Immigrant Filipino (Youth)** | **Immigrant Filipino (Older Gen)** | **Non-Filipino Friend** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *[Before showing prototype]* When you think of Christmas, what images come to mind? Are you aware of the weather patterns during that time? | Parols, Ber months, Noche Buena. Yes, I’m highly aware that this period overlaps with the worst of the typhoon season. | Lights, caroling, big family parties, and the food. I know it’s typhoon season *because of mama*, but the connection to Christmas isn’t always top of mind unless a storm is actively hitting. | I think about Jose Mari Chan. My family still celebrates Noche Buena but at a smaller scale because there aren't many Filipinos in my state. When I was little, I remember there was always big parties and all the kids would be together.I remember rain, but the severity of the December storms is something I learned about later here in the U.S. | We used to always do Noche Buena, but that hasn't been my experience anymore, especially after marrying an American and having children. Back when I was living in the province, we learned to expect storms and prepare our homes because we were near the ocean. It was an annual source of anxiety, even though our house was elevated. It's not just about impact on us, but also on our neighbors. That's because we're Filipino and we care about other people—community, right? | I think about snow, Hallmark movies, Die Hard, you singing Christmas songs, and spending time with my family. I wasn’t aware that right before Christmas time in the Philippines is also their peak severe weather/typhoon season. ||
| How did the use of imagery impact your experience with the website? | The photos are beautiful and sad. I think it is good that they are included so we can better convince local non-profits of the severity. | The visual contrast was jarring in a good way. The destruction photos felt heavy and hit me hard, but I liked the ending photos of people helping each other. I also liked the rainbow thank you image like rainbows after the rain.| Very emotional. Seeing the wrecked homes made the conflict personal and immediate, maybe would be nice to see it next to the stats since all the stats are near each other. I think they are far more than reading statistics alone. | You almost made me cry remembering what happened. The images after the typhoons reminded me a lot of the places I grew up in. Back then, infrastructure was not as good so you would always see destruction like what you showed. | I didn't realize how destructive the storms were and how different the buildings are. It was very sad to see, especially with the kid on the other kid's back. I liked the videos zooming out and in for the contrast. ||
| Were there any unclear terms to you? | No because we are used to seeing IDPs and these types of stats. That's how it is when you keep being flooded with it online. | No. | No, the terms were clear to me and I liked that you expanded on them with the graphs.	| Wellbeing vs asset losses wasn't clear to me, but I might just not be used to those terms. I also didn't know what displaced meant. | I knew what wellbeing and asset losses are, but did not know that displaced people can be disaster-related, I always associate it with conflict (like Palestine). ||
| For the terms 'Noche Buena' or 'Bayanihan', did you feel you needed more explanation to understand the significance? | No, this is tied with our culture. Everyone knows these words, or should. | No, their inclusion made the story feel unique and more Filipino, if that makes sense. | Maybe "bayanihan" for non-Tagalog speakers. I know my brain paused before I read the description right after it. | No, these words have strong meanings that I don't know how to translate. | I understood Noche Buena meant the Christmas Eve feast from the photos. "Bayanihan" was explained in the same sentence but I think I skipped over it. ||
| What did you feel about the use of graphs and statistics? *(Potential Follow-up: Were they overwhelming? Helpful? Necessary?)* | I think when you try to explain things to foreigners, they like to see data so this is good.	| They felt a little overwhelming. I found the visual data to be nice to look at. | The graphics were helpful because I didn't know just how much the impact was. I also liked the breakdown of islands. I wonder if there is info on more recent storms. I liked that you showed the specific number of days before. | Even though I like the photos more, the graphs were definitely necessary for the argument. I liked that they focused on the storms relevant to the Christmas time rather than generic stats. | Some sections felt too dense. The charts showing typhoons near Christmas were the most successful and easy to absorb quickly. However, I didn't know what the colors were for. Maybe a timeline would be nice to show how many there are. ||
| Do you remember the selected quotes? What were your thoughts on them? | I remember there were two but the second was long. I remember the first “We always celebrate Christmas, but for now, it’s hard.” | I remember the “too hard” quote. It was a good human-level pause and made the loss tangible, not just abstract disaster. | I remember how I felt for both quotes. It felt like we were humanizing the impact like "yes, these are people!" And I related hard with the distance quote, especially having moved so young. I never knew how to help and most of my family is in the U.S. now. | I liked the quote from the father. I agree that it is hard. It is really hard to celebrate or even be happy when your neighbors aren't doing well. And that's from me having my house flooded multiple times. | I remember the quote about it being hard to do Christmas and it shocked me. To me, Christmas has always been a break. It is so different here. ||
| Do you feel like you know how to help? Or know where to look to find ways to help? | Yes! I will definitely like to share this with local organizations to convince them that we are worth paying attention to. | Kind of? I know how to donate, but not how to plan my own event, which scares me if my mom wants me to be an officer like her. | Yes, the list was very expansive. I liked that “sharing the story” was included, I feel like many people can do that. | Yes, but I don't know if I will yet. | I know where to find it. ||
| Is the connection between 'coffee money' and 'exchange rate' motivating? | Motivating. I think this would be good for showing people how much their help can mean to a family. | Motivating. I didn't realize the scaling of income. Very low cost to me but high benefit in the Philippines. | Motivating. I wonder who we would send the money to though. It didn’t feel like “marketing” and I think people who reach this part of the website were already interested. | A little bit marketing, but effective. I know it can be tiring sometimes getting asked for help. I still have family at home after all. But I think showing the scale is good. | Highly motivating. I think it was the best part of the call to action and could be it's own page. I know donating can feel burdensome for some especially when we're broke students too, but I didn't realize a $5 bill could go so far. ||
| Would you feel comfortable sharing this link with your own family/network? | Absolutely. It’s very high-quality. | Yes!! Everyone should know about this. | Maybe, I don't share this type of information usually. | Yes! I think people from my province would relate. | Maybe not since I don't know who I would share it too, but it was very interesting. ||

### Class Feedback

During the in-class feedback session, three second-year MISM classmates gave the website highly positive reviews. The prototype was identified as production-ready and the data visualizations were described as accurate, readable, and digestible. However, similar comments were made to the non-Filipino interviewee. This showed me that some Filipino-specific context was needed if I wanted this to be accessible for non-Filipino viewers such as local non-profit organizations.

# Identified changes for Part 3

The five interviews from different demographics were very helpful and a lot of insights were taken. The table below outlines potential changes I can consider for Part 3.

| Research synthesis | Changes to consider for Part III |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Users strongly connected Christmas with typhoon season *only if they were Filipino or Filipino-American*. | This justifies the contextual intro explaining the December typhoon overlap before showing imagery or data. It also may be good to show why exactly the Philippines is prone to storms (i.e., geography, climate).|
| Emotional imagery (destroyed homes, flooding) was powerful but overwhelming for some viewers. | Maybe use emotional images more sparingly? Some found the photos very helpful and eye-opening. It may be good to alternate more between story and data to reduce emotional fatigue.|
| Cultural terms like *Noche Buena* and *Bayanihan* were unevenly understood across groups. | [Maybe] add small explanations at the bottom of each page or include a small glossary at the end of the website.|
| Quotes were highly memorable and helped users emotionally anchor the story. Quotes were more easily recalled than stats. | I think it was a good idea beginning the "Dark Christmas" and "Giving Christmas" sections with quotes, then following with data or information to support the emotional context.         |
| Sections with many graphs felt dense or overwhelming. Some users skipped these areas. | I think having clearer spaces to outline what the graphs mean may be helpful (or the graphs could be simplified).|
| Non-Filipino users said the data helped them understand severity but lacked context on why the storms hit hardest. | Add a short explainer on the Philippines’ geography, frequency of cyclones, and vulnerability factors. |
| Users appreciated breakdowns by island/region but non-Filipino wasn't sure what they were.| Consider adding a geographic visual, in tandem with why the Philippines is prone to storms.|
| Users didn’t always understand how the "money raised" or "evacuation rate" metrics connected to real outcomes. | Try to find concrete examples of websites to donate to. |
| Many users said they would help but didn’t know who to share with and what to share. | Strengthen call-to-action section by having a shareable link or caption? |
| Filipino users valued cultural authenticity and accuracy. Non-Filipinos felt lost at times. | I think here, I would like to prioritize Filipino readers, but I understand that some also do not speak Filipino. Because of this, I will consider adding more translations. |
| Users said the site felt “high-quality” and trustworthy, making them comfortable sharing it. | Maintain clean design, and maybe add social-sharing buttons. |
| Multiple people said seeing before/after contrasts was helpful. | Ensure this stays in the final draft. |

Across all the interviews, users consistently valued the emotional resonance and cultural authenticity of the story.
This makes me think about if telling the story in English is the right call or if I should incorporate even more Filipino culture into the story. There was also a need for clearer context, especially for younger audience members.

The photography, videography, and quotes were identified as the strongest points. This leads me to think that people like to hear from people and to *see* human impact. The data was appreciated as additional context, which makes me want to keep it. However, I will try to pull back as to keep it as supplementary.

Focusing on clarity, narrative pacing, and accessible explanations will make the experience more meaningful and actionable for a broader audience.
