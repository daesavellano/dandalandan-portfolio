<!-- _For each step below, you should document your progress as you move forward.  In terms of tone, think of the writeup as though you're keeping journal of your step-by-step process.   You should include a any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently._

_You can include screenshots, sketches or other artifacts with your narrative to help tell the story of how you moved through the process.  Again, make sure to avoid including any personally identifying information about your interviewees (don't list full names, etc.).  While this template serves as a guide, make sure to reference the assignment writeup on Canvas for the official guidance. This template does not include all guidance mentioned on the assignment page._ -->

## Step One: The Visualization

<!-- _Include link to the original data visualization (or screenshot - make sure to correctly cite your sources, etc.).  Include paragraph or two on why you selected this particular data visualization.  For obvious reasons, the data visualization you select should come from a publicly accessible source._ -->

For this redesign, I am primarily looking at the landing page and the first graph you can see when you scroll on the [Eviction Tracking System](https://evictionlab.org/eviction-tracking/) by [The Eviction Lab](https://evictionlab.org/about/) at Princeton University. This is based on data from the [2023/W38 Makeover Monday challenge](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2023w38).

- The visualization is the first thing a user sees on the tracking page, featuring a map of the United States and large summary statistics.
- The second visualization can be seen after scrolling to the next page.
- Beyond the screenshot, there are additional visualizations that can be revealed by scrolling to the “filings by location" section.

**Why I chose this visualization**
- **As a designer and storyteller,** I thought that redesigning this visualization would be a fun challenge. I added the constraints of matching the organization’s branding. It was already a lovely baseline, and my goal is not to top it. Instead, my main goal is to make it more consolidated and add a story layer.
- **As an aspiring health policy analyst,** The topic of eviction is very important, and the dataset I was able to get from Makeover Monday only had data from 2020-2023, with the baseline being pre-pandemic levels.

## Step Two: The Critique
<!-- _Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._ -->

## Step Three: Sketch a Solution

## Step Four: Test the Solution

<!-- _Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._ -->

<!-- Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- What else would you like to know about eviction data? -->

Results: 

<!-- _Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._ -->


| Question                              | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|Can you tell me what you think this is?|             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

<!-- _What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._ -->

## Step Five: Build the Solution

<!-- _Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._ -->
