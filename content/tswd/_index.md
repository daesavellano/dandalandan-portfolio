Welcome to my portfolio for Carnegie Mellon University's Telling Stories with Data (94-870) course for Fall 2025. This page showcases my journey in learning to effectively communicate insights through data visualization and storytelling.

## About Me

I'm Danielle Aira Savellano (or Dana or Dan), a graduate student pursuing my M.S. in Health Care Analytics and Information Technology at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. With a background in Biology, Computer Science, and Global Health Studies from Allegheny College, I'm passionate about bridging the gap between healthcare and technology through evidence-based, community-focused solutions.

One thing not a lot of people know about me is that I went to a science high school. Throughout that time, I was very interested in art and design. It's no wonder that I now have a mission to translate complex data into actionable (and beautiful) insights that address real-world challenges. Through this class, I developed the skills necessary to tell compelling stories with data that can drive meaningful change in healthcare and public policy.

## What I Hoped to Learn

My career goal is to **use data to inform and improve health policy**. I am flexible in my function, with interests in roles like data analysis, policy research, and program management. My scope of interest is broad, spanning both the healthcare delivery system and the wider public health landscape, as I believe factors like community violence, education, and housing are critical determinants of health.

Through the Telling Stories with Data course, I did the following:

- **Showcased mastery of data visualization principles**: I created clear, compelling, and accurate visualizations that effectively communicated needed insights.

- **Developed storytelling skills:** I understood how to structure narratives around data to engage audiences and drive action, similar to the [1 pixel wealth](https://eattherichtextformat.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/) example.

- **Built on my existing Tableau skills:** I improved my dashboarding and visualization skills, building on my experiences with my past two summer internships wherein I worked with Tableau visualizations.

- **Built a professional portfolio:** I created a collection of data stories and finally finished (a draft of) my portfolio so that I can demonstrate my capabilities to potential employers and collaborators!

## Portfolio

### Self-Introduction Visualization

<center><img src="/images/posts/tswd/tswd_intro.png" alt="Self-Intro" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; max-height: 400px;" /></center>

For my introductory sketch, I captured the flow of my personal energy levels throughout the day. The x-axis tracks the day's events (not to scale) and the y-axis represents my energy. I went to sleep past midnight, so my energy levels started at zero. My energy rises after waking up and breakfast, but then drains from my bike commute and three back-to-back classes (despite a small spike from enjoying my classes). The graph's biggest spike is from spending time with my boyfriend, which I captured as the main energy-gaining activity of the day (note: it is definitely exaggerated). After that, another class, intramural frisbee, and doomscrolling on Instagram drains my energy until I crash on my bed.

### Sample Data Visualizations

Throughout the seven-week course, I developed a number of sample visualizations. Some of them can be found below.

- [Data Visualization Examples](/tswd/dataviz)
    - [Visualizing the Titanic Manifesto](/tswd/dataviz/#visualizing-the-titanic-manifesto)
    - [Recreating a Gapminder Chart with Tableau](/tswd/dataviz/#recreating-a-gapminder-chart-with-tableau)
    - [Government Debt-to-GDP Ratios](/tswd/dataviz/#government-debt-to-gdp-ratios)
    - [Learning Tableau and Datawrapper](/tswd/dataviz/#learning-tableau-and-datawrapper)

### Critique by Design

The [Critique by Design](/tswd/critique) assignment was a very iterative process, which included a brief user research feedback loop.

### Final Project

During the latter half of the course, my efforts were focused on developing my final project. This focused on the idea of Christmas typhoons in the Philippines from the view of the Filipino-American diaspora.

- [Part 1](/tswd/project_1): Proposal and Wireframe
- [Part 2](/tswd/project_2): Website Prototype and User Research
- [Part 3](/tswd/project_3): Documentation of Design Decisions and Motivations
- [Silent Night, Stormy Plight](/tswd/silent_night_stormy_plight): The Interactive Data Story

#### A summary of the above projects can be found below!
