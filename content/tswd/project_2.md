# Wireframes / storyboards

In Part 1, I developed a wireframe using Canva. This became the basis for Part 2, but with adjustments based on the information I retrieved from the data files and the availability of copyright-free images and videos.

For Part 2, I moved directly into a high-fidelity mockup/prototype using Shorthand to better visualize the scrolling transitions and stollytelling elements of the narrative. The story follows a specific arc designed to take the reader from nostalgia to reality to action.

## The Narrative Arc & Visualizations:

1. **The Hook** (A Long Christmas): The story opens with Black & White imagery of Christmas, transitioning into color to represent the joy and light of the season. For non-Filipino (and Filipino) readers, emphasis was put on the Ber months.

2. **The Conflict** (The Uninvited Guest):

    - Here, I transition from a *"Christmas is an amazing season"* to a *"...but not for everyone"* angle
    - Visualizations in this phase include photos after a storm, directly addressing comments in an in-class critique of my wireframe ("no shelter, no electricity, no Christmas").
    - I also included a quote that I found to be particularly striking: *"We always celebrated Christmas, but for now, it’s too hard."*

3. **The Human Cost** (A Dark Christmas):
    There are also visualizations and callout statistics regarding the human cost of typhoons, and specifically Christmas typhoons.
    - It starts with general statistics (i.e., #1 rank on World Risk Index, increasing frequency of storms, and the seasonal overlap of typhoons and the months leading to December)
    - There are general statistics on Pilippine internally displaced persons due to disasters, along with cost-breakdowns of wellbeing losses and asset losses
    - It is followed by stacked bar charts that highlight specific typhoons (Ruby, Nona, Tisoy, Ursula) that made landfall close to December 25. The charts visualize *"People Affected"* (millions) and *"Damaged Houses"*(hundreds of thousands).

4. **The Call to Action** (A Giving Christmas): In this section, I talk about how distance doesn't mean disconnection.
    - I use traditional Filipino context like *"bayanihan"*, along with matching photos.
    - I outline specific steps that can be done from the U.S., such as (donating, monitoring the PH government, organizing local initiatives, and sharing the story).
    - I emphasize the USD/PHP exchange rate, comparing a Philippine feast to an American cup of coffee.

# User research 

## Target audience

My primary audience includes the Filipino diaspora (specifically Filipino-Americans) and allies who are culturally connected to the Philippines but geographically removed from the immediate impact of storms.

To find representative individuals, I reached out to:

- **Community Members**: One adult officer and youth member from a Filipino-American organization, to see if the story aligns with their advocacy needs.
- **U.S.-born Filipinos**: A Filipino-American student who grew up in the U.S. celebrates Filipino-Chinese Christmas Eve, and "relies on news to understand conditions back home."
- **Immigrant Filipinos (Youth)**: A Filipino-American student who moved to the U.S. at a young age, celebrates Filipino Christmas Eve, and is "not too aware of what is going on at home beyond generic information."
- **Immigrant Filipinos (Older Generation)**: A Filipino-American who moved to the U.S. during their college years, celebrates American Christmas Eve, and is "not too aware of what is going on at home beyond from Facebook headlines."
- **Non-Filipino-American**: A non-Filipino friend to test if the cultural context (Parols, Simbang Gabi, Christmas Typhoons) makes sense to an outsider.

I also conducted interviews for my Part 1 wireframe, but did not include the results below. Prior to interviews with my specific audience, I will conduct an in-class critique to assess how the website is received by non-Filipinos and non-Filipino/American readers.

## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask. 

TODO About the goal of user research — looking at emotional resonance, data clarity, and cultural context accessibility

Below is a list of questions I am interested in asking. Some questions may only apply for certain demographics.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|To determine baseline associations for Christmas|*[Before showing prototype]* When you think of Christmas in the Philippines, what images come to mind? Are you aware of the weather patterns during that time?|
|To check emotional impact|How did the transition from the 'Christmas' images to the 'Storm' images make you feel?|
|To evaluate cultural context|For the terms 'Noche Buena' or 'Bayanihan', did you feel you needed more explanation to understand the significance?|
|To assess use of data|What did you feel about the use of graphs and statistics? *(Potential Follow-up: Were they overwhelming? Helpful? Necessary?)*|
|To assess data labeling clarity|Was it clear what the terms "people affected," "people displaced," "damaged houses," and "wellbeing vs asset losses" are?|
|To assess quote resonance|Do you remember the selected quotes? What were your thoughts on them?|
|To assess call to action|After reading the end of the story, do you feel like you know how to help?|
|To see if the coffee comparison landed well|Is the connection between 'coffee money' and 'exchange rate' motivating? *(Potential Follow-up: Does it motivate you to donate, or does it feel like marketing?)*|
|To see sharability|Would you feel comfortable sharing this link with your own family/network?|
