I have been living in Pittsburgh for almost two years now, so I was very excited to find this challenge intersecting Pittsburgh public policy data visualization!

**Objective:** To analyze 2017-2020 Capital Improvement Projects in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, evaluating the city's efforts to address the lingering impacts of historical housing discrimination (redlining) against African American communities.

**Approach**: This dashboard was developed based on the [Back2VizBasics (2022/W19)](https://data.world/back2vizbasics/2022week-19-use-an-action) challenge, with a focus on bridging data analytics and public policy.
- **Data Integration**: Independently sourced and integrated outside datasets in addition to what was provided in the B2VB challenge. These include a City of Pittsburgh shapefile and demographic census data from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Implemented Tableau Actions to create dynamic legend-based filtering, allowing users to interactively explore the data.
- **Independent Development**: Designed and executed the entire project from scratch, including all exploratory analysis and complex map visualizations, without relying on external guides.

As you explore the dashboard below, feel free to interact with the hover-and-click functionalities. Additional information can also be obtained by hovering over the visualizations.
