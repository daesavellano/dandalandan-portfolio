# The Final Data Story

<a href="https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/silent-night-stormy-plight-the-typhoons-that-stole-filipino-christmas/index.html" style="background-color: #D8BFE3; color: #121729; padding: 12px 20px; display: inline-block; border-radius: 14px;"><b>Silent Night, Stormy Plight</b></a>

For the final version, I focused on improving the emotional storytelling by providing critical context to help ground the narrative in both geography and economic reality.

1. **Adding Context for Geography and Vulnerability**: A key insight from Part 2 feedback was that audiences unfamiliar with the Philippines didn't fully grasp the "why." I added a section explaining the country's archipelagic nature and its location in the Pacific Typhoon Belt to show why it is so prone to storms. This may still be improved, given that I won't always be there to explain it, but for now it will do. I also detailed how many communities are dependent on agriculture and fisheries. This context highlights that a typhoon isn't just an immediate safety hazard or the loss of electricity, it represents income lost, schools destroyed, and food security threatened. This helps the audience understand that this is a systemic issue.

2. **Expanding Quantitative Measures**: To complement the narrative, I wanted to show the scale of the geographic impact. I added more robust quantitative measures visualized through an interactive map. This allows users to toggle between metrics such as agricultural economic loss, infrastructural damage, and lives impacted. My goal was to demonstrate that the devastation extends far beyond the immediate storm, causing long-term economic setbacks.

3. **Connecting Dollars to Pesos**: I realized my original "Call to Action" was a long list that felt abstract. Users in the U.S. might not understand how far their dollar goes in the Philippines, especially given inflation and currency conversion rates. To make this concrete, I created a hand-drawn image comparing a standard U.S. coffee shop order to a Christmas Eve feast (Noche Buena) for a family of four in the Philippines. This visualization transformed a donation into a more tangible breakfast/dinner comparison, making the impact of giving feel immediate and personal.

# Presentation Mode

<a href="https://preview.shorthand.com/it5ovlLCLuO6p0jw" style="background-color: #D8BFE3; color: #121729; padding: 12px 20px; display: inline-block; border-radius: 14px;"><b>1-Minute Presentation Version</b> (Shortened)</a>

I greatly shortened the content for the live presentation version of the story. Knowing that my one-minute presentation was for a general audience (many with zero knowledge on Filipinos), I focused primarily on creating an immediate emotional connection through photography and videography rather than text density.

I specifically cut out many of the introductory text sections. However, I kept the visual contrast technique: zooming out from the nativity scene and then zooming in while walking through the rubble post-typhoon. I received a lot of positive feedback on that specific visual sequence during the feedback session, and the lineup of videos did the heavy lifting, allowing me to keep the text minimal and impactful.

# The Audience

From the ideation phase, I knew exactly who my target audience was: **the Filipino diaspora**. More specifically, I wanted to reach out to Filipinos and Filipino-Americans in the United States, as well as their allies. I consider these populations to be people who are culturally connected to the Philippines but geographically removed from the immediate physical impact of the storms.

This audience was identified during my first unofficial interview with Filipino Americans in the U.S. and refined through many informal conversations with Filipino high school friends who studied abroad. Furthermore, during this process, I became much more involved with the Filipino community in Pittsburgh, which helped me tailor the narrative to resonate with our shared cultural nostalgia for Christmas.

# Final Design Decisions & Story Snippets

## Visual Connection with Colors and Imagery

### Color Palette Selection

For the final design, I loosely used a Christmas-adjacent color scheme with dark teals, reds, and yellows. This helped keep the presentation visually cohesive without being garish or overly commercial. I especially thought that a bright, cheery red would have felt disrespectful given the topic of disaster. This allowed me to visually signal the holiday season while maintaining the seriousness required. I also used brighter colors for happier imagery and darker colors for more solemn themes (ex. quotes).

### Lightning Videography in Title Page

In the title page, we can immediately see a storm brewing. The lightning flashing in the background helps set the mood.

### Imagery Juxtaposition

I used visual contrast as a narrative device. When introducing the typhoons, I "zoomed out" from the holiday nativity scene and then "zoomed in" while walking through the rubble post-typhoon. I hoped to show this as focusing out from our own view of Christmas (which is assumed to be calmer) and focusing on the Christmas experienced by those in typhoon areas. This visual tension forces the reader to confront the reality that these two worlds exist simultaneously. I received a lot of positive feedback on that specific visual sequence during the feedback session, and the lineup of videos did the heavy lifting, allowing me to keep the text minimal and impactful.

## Human Impact with Quotes and Statistics

### Quotes as a Section Breaker

I used two quotes to start the sections for "A Dark Christmas" and "A Giving Christmas" and to break the rhythm of scrolling. These sections were centered on a plain background to demand attention. By isolating these quotes, I wanted to show the actual voices of the typhoon victims and the diaspora. These anecdotes capture the sentiments of the entire story I was trying to tell: (1) the difficulty of celebrating Christmas when you are fighting for your survival, and (2) the difficulty of seeing everything unfold and feeling like you are not able to do anything. These quotes were taken from a news interview and a personal interview.

</div>

### General and Christmas-Specific Impact

I created the impact sections to show a macro-view of general impacts of storms and micro-views of Christmas storms specifically. By highlighting specific Christmas typhoons, I wanted to show how some of these typhoons were so close to the day of Christmas itself. This is why I specifically chose Typhoon Ursula since it happened only two days before Christmas 2019. While impact was mentioned in the previous section, this puts the numbers in the forefront.

</div>

## Two-Part Call to Action

I wanted to provide users with agency, but I didn't want the ending to be too overwhelming. To solve this, I created a two-part call to action:

<!-- Call to Action: Long and Short -->

<div style="display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap; gap:1rem; justify-content:center; align-items:flex-start;">
    <img src="/images/posts/tswd/final_project/part_three/40_call_to_action.png" alt="Call to Action: Videos" style="max-width:48%; width:48%; height:auto;" />

</div>

### A Comprehensive List

First, I included a longer list of ways to help. This establishes credibility and offers options for users who want to dive deep (volunteering, specific NGOs, advocacy). Currently, there are not many organizations listed (only 5), but this is something I would have wanted to improve with time.

### A Digestible Graphic

To hone in on the power of the dollar, I created a simplified, hand-drawn graphic. This is similar to what I originally wanted to do in my wireframe, but had trouble of visualizing. This choice was made specifically after consulting with the professor. This visualizes a low-barrier entry point (the price of a coffee and sandwich) so even if a reader skimmed the long list, they would leave with one digestible (and hopefully memorable!) action item.

## Why My Heart Is In The Work

### Putting My Motivations Last

I felt it was important to show *why* this story matters to me, both logically and emotionally. I chose to place this section at the very end of the narrative, after the "Thank You" but before the references.

During the feedback process, my professor asked a valid question: **Why not lead with this?** Why not start the story with my personal connection?

The answer is simple: **This story isn't mine alone.**

While my experience validates the narrative, centering myself first would narrow the scope. Yes, I grew up with floods. I have seen beds floating, I have waded through rising waters, I have had memories destroyed, and I recall doing disaster drills as early as second grade—mapping out evacuation routes for my house and preparing emergency kits for flashlights, food, and meds. I remember the details vividly: bathing in the dark with only storm water (the pipes were no longer running), doing homework by candlelight (afraid of the many bugs that were also seeking refuge from the rain), and listening to the howling of stray dogs outside (they had nowhere to go).

However, **my story is not the worst of it**. And, to be honest, I pushed back most of it until I started writing this reflection piece. Today, I watch from the safety of the U.S., feeling the specific helplessness of the diaspora. Sometimes, it's guilt—*guilt because it's so much easier to not pay attention*. By placing my story at the end, I ensure the focus remains on the community currently on the ground, while still showing the user where my passion stems from.

### A Mix of Head and Heart (Quantitative and Qualitative Factors)

I designed two distinct visual elements to represent my motivating factors:

- **Quantitative** (The Opportunity): I used data to show the sheer scale of the Filipino-American community (4.1 million). I also showed how there are massive hubs of potential donors and advocates across the U.S. that could be mobilized.

- **Qualitative** (The Personal Connection): While I didn't tell the story above, I did mention some specific details from more recent years of my life. I moved to the U.S. in 2021 and watched Typhoon Odette's impact from 8,000 miles away. While I was fortunate enough to be funded for a service-based internship during the following summer, most of the diaspora doesn't have that privilege. I also mentioned conversations I had with the local Filipino-American Association of Pittsburgh This visual bridges the gap between my memories and my current reality.
